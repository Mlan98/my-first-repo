# my-first-repo
A repository for getting the hang of GitHub. 
My main hobbies include art, video games, tattooing, going to concerts, watching movies, etc.
I am comfortable in Python from CSC 221 and am still learning Java in CSC 222. The first coding that I've ever done is when I stearted at BRCC in the fall of 2024.
